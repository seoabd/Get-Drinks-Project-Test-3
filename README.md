Once upon a time, a wedding host decided to entertain the guests with a fun rule: every guest would give a toast, and everyone present would drink to the health of the newlyweds. For example:

When the first guest arrives, they drink alone.
When the second guest arrives, they drink together.
The third guest arrives, and all three drink, and so on.
ðŸ’¡ If there are 5 guests, then we need 15 drinks in total (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15); and if 10, then 55 drinks (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55).

Create the getDrinks function that:

Takes the number of wedding guests â€” numberOfGuests.
Returns the total number of drinks.
